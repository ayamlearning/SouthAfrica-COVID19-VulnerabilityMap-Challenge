# SouthAfrica-COVID19-VulnerabilityMap-Challenge
The task was to predict the percentage of households that fall  into a particularly vulnerable bracket - large households who must  leave their homes to fetch water - using 2011 South African census data.  Solving this challenge with machine learning proved that it was possible to use  easy-to-measure stats to identify areas most at risk even in years when   census data is not collected.
